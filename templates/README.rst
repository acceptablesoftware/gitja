gitserve templates
==================

This folder contains some example templates for demonstration purposes.

They can be used for generation by specifying the path of one of the folders in
the ``gitserve`` configuration file as the ``templateDirectory``.

If you make a nice template and would like to share it, contributions of more
folders here would be very welcome!

The templates and their descriptions:

============= ==========================================
Template name Description
============= ==========================================
docs          This is used for generating gitserve's docs website.
stagit        This replicates much of stagit_'s style.
============= ==========================================
